# ðŸ›µ Delivery App
A delivery-app webpage developed as a [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com) Project.

## ðŸ’» About this project
This is a full-stack project in which front-end, back-end and database were build from scratch.

Through front-end layer, the user can use all back-end layer services. The services include to log in, register new customer, manage sellers, make beverage orders, list orders, check order details, and change order status. Front-end is a Single Page Application and back-end is a RESTful API built in Model-Service-Controller architecture.

The application has 4 user flows:
- Common Flow: comprehends login and register pages.
- Customer Flow: comprehends products, checkout, orders and order details pages.
- Seller Flow: comprehends orders and order details/management pages.
- Administrator Flow: comprehends users management page.

Both front-end and back-end layers have some tests implemented.
